        <h2>Introduction</h2>
      </br>
        <p>Flow Builder provides declarative process automation for every Salesforce app, experience, and portal with point-and-click automation. I joined this team in April 2022 and have since been working on releasing changes that aim to consistently improve user productivity and experience.</p>
        <p class="highlight">The primary goal of this Flow Builder's redesign was to offer users a <span>modernized and simplified layout that remains inclusive to all</span>. This involves a cleaner and more visually appealing interface with improved navigation, as well as improving user experience for those that are sight-impaired with colors that meet accessibility requirements. </p>
        <p>The modifications were implemented in Java, Typescript, HTML, and CSS.
        </p>

      </br>

        <h2>So, what's the problem?</h2>
        </br>
        <p style="padding-bottom:30px;">As the Flow Builder user base expands and increasingly complex flows emerge, we received feedback about the challenges of navigating the flow. Previously, the sole navigation method was dragging the canvas to view off-screen elements and scrolling to zoom for clearer visibility.</p>
        <img src="img/canvas-enhancements/drag-gif.gif" alt="canvas drag gif">
        <p style="padding-top:30px;"> The following are the core problems this product aims to solve: </p>
        <ul>
          <li class="error-highlight"><span>Users would lose element positioning on the canvas</span>. The zoom level would reset with every element interaction. If you were building a large flow, this was a headache to deal with. It frustrated users and negatively impacted user productivity.</li>
          <li class="error-highlight"><span>The icon colors were inaccessible</span>. They did not meet the contrast ratio of at least 3:1 for graphics and user interface components. This was a requirement specified by Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1. Our features were isolating our users, especially those that are sight-impaired.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-12 project-sub-summary">
        <p class="sub-header">WHEN WAS THIS?</p>
        <p>Dec 2022 - Feb 2023</p>
        </br>
        <p class="sub-header">WHAT'D I DO?</p>
        <p>I served as the lead Software Engineer for this feature, overseeing the entire project cycle.</p>
        <p>My responsibilities included:
          <ul>
            <li>Project scoping and presenting proof-of-concepts to discern technical specifications.</li>
            <li>Identifying potential technical challenges.</li>
            <li>Dissecting the feature into digestible work items.</li>
            <li>Implementing code and creating comprehensive test plans.</li>
            <li>Organizing and leading bug blitzes to identify user issues.</li>
            <li>Presenting the end product to key stakeholders and company executives.</li>
           </ul>
         </p>
        <p>During this process, I worked in tandem with the UX team, Product Managers, and my engineering team to ideate and troubleshoot.</p>

      <div class="ux-deliverables">
        <h2>The Process</h2>
        </br>
        <p>As a Software Engineer in Salesforce, my responsibilities start when I receive feature deliverables by the User Experience team.</p>

          <img src="img/canvas-enhancements/deliverables-2.png" alt="ux deliverables">
        </div>
        <p class="highlight">I began by conducting a spike, <span>a time-boxed research into the codebase to explore potential solutions and identify technical challenges</span>. This research would conclude with a detailed presentation of my findings and a demo of proof-of-concepts to my team.</p>
        <img class="center spike-example padding-top" src="img/canvas-enhancements/spike-eg.jpg" alt="spike example">

      <div class="update-icon-story">
        <h2 class="heading-padding">Update The <img class="plus-icon" src="img/canvas-enhancements/plus-icon.png" alt="plus icon"> Icon</h2>
        </br>
        <p>The first noticeable enhancement was changing the icon to a <img class="circle-icon" src="img/canvas-enhancements/circle-icon.png" alt="circle icon"> icon that enlarges to the <img class="plus-icon" src="img/canvas-enhancements/plus-icon.png" alt="plus icon"> icon when interacted with.</p>
        <img class="hover-animation padding-top-bottom" src="img/canvas-enhancements/hover-animation.gif" alt="icon hover animation gif">
        <p class="highlight">With this update, there were <span>four animation cases</span> to consider.</p>

      <div class="add-help-popover-story">
        <h2 class="heading-padding">Add Help Popover</h2>
        </br>
        <p>With the significant visual update, we wanted to provide users a help popover that explains how one can interact with the new interface.</p>
        <div class="row">
          <img class="popover-example padding-top" src="img/canvas-enhancements/popover-eg.png" alt="popover example">
          <img class="popover-req" src="img/canvas-enhancements/popover-requirements.png" alt="popover requirements">

            <p>An Example of Issue #1</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p class="short-padding-top">Multiple attempts at a solution were made to resolve the three issues in keeping the popover anchored. However, no solution could not solve all three issues simultaneously.</p>
        </br>
        <p class="highlight">Eventually, I sought the guidance of the Salesforce In-App Guidance team, and together, implemented an algorithm that keeps the popover anchored with every window resize and shift in Flow. This same algorithm has become a core piece in ensuring that the Flow remains <span>adaptable</span> to diverse media sizes and user interactions.</p>
        </br>
        <p>Panels were also adjusted such that they would never overlap with the popover.</p>
      </br>
      </div>

      <div class="shorten-distance-story">
        <h2 class="heading-padding">Shorten The Distance Between Vertical Nodes</h2>
        </br>
        <p class="highlight">This feature involved a simple change in variable value in a file that calculated all element configurations. After spiking this feature, I found <span>two methods of implementation</span> that my team and I could discuss and finalize on.</p>
        <div class="row">
          <img class="center shorten-dist-spike-example padding-top" src="img/canvas-enhancements/shorten-dist-spike.png" alt="shorten distance spike example">
          <img class="shorten-dist-issue" src="img/canvas-enhancements/shorten-dist-issue.png" alt="shorten distance issue">
        </div>
        <p>After multiple feedback sessions and multi-team discussions with UX and my team, an acceptable variable value was agreed upon that could meet both the feature requirement and accommodate unique cases like the Decision element.</p>
        </br>
      </div>

      <div class="reduce-width-story">
        <h2 class="heading-padding">Reduce The Width Of Connectors</h2>
        </br>
        <p>Part of the move towards improving the canvas interface was reducing the overall width of the connectors. This also involved a small change in variable value.</p>
        <div class="row">
          <img class="reduce-width padding-top-bottom" src="img/canvas-enhancements/reduce-width-img.png" alt="reduce width example">
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="color-contrast-story">
        <h2 class="heading-padding">Increase The Contrast Of Nodes And Connectors</h2>
        </br>
        <p>Prior to this update, Flow Builder displayed colors that were not WCAG 2.1 compliant. After consulting with the UX team and obtaining the necessary css requirements, I began identifying the areas that required modifications.</p>
        <div class="row">
          <img class="color-contrast padding-top-bottom" src="img/canvas-enhancements/color-contrast.png" alt="color contrast example">
        </div>
        <p>The code was straightforward, but its application demanded consideration of all node and connector variations. Thus, before embarking on the changes, I needed to thoroughly investigate the source code for these variants and all their possible use cases.</p>
      </br>
        <p class="highlight">This feature adjustment was particularly notable for me. Throughout my career, it was among the few tasks I undertook that highlighted a <span>distinct interface-driven customer need</span>. Addressing this would greatly enhance both productivity and inclusivity for its users.
        </p>

      </div>

      <div class="results">
        <h2 class="heading-padding">Drum Roll, Please... The Finished Product</h2>
        </br>
        <p>On the left, you'd see what Flow Builder was before the changes. On the right, you'd see how the Flow Builder canvas has improved after the changes.</p>

        <p class="highlight">The newly-upgraded canvas layout that boasts <span>a more compact view with improved accessibility standards</span> received praise during its Summer ‘23 release.

        <h2 class="heading-padding">Phew, What A Learning Journey!</h2>
        </br>
        <p>When I first took on the leadership role for this project, I grappled with self-doubt, often questioning my capabilities as the youngest Software Engineer on a seasoned team. My experience was marked by daily challenges, collaborative brainstorming and intensive problem-solving.</p>
        </br>
        <p class="highlight" style="padding-bottom: 20px">My manager and mentor played crucial roles in encouraging me to <span>stay curious</span>. I'll never forget the response I received to my apprehension about asking questions, which completely transformed my outlook on speaking up.</p>
        </br>
        <p class="quote">“You never know if someone also has the same question as you or if your question might offer a new perspective. By asking your question, you could be helping someone else too.”</p>
        </br>
        <p style="padding-top: 20px">Looking back at the successful impact of the feature on user productivity and accessibility, I'm deeply thankful for my team's unwavering support that fueled my confidence and determination to lead the project to its success.</p>
