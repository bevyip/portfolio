        <h2>Introduction</h2>
      </br>
        <p>Flow Builder is the most powerful automation tool that any Salesforce user has at their disposal. It can be used to perform various tasks from sending an email and posting a message to performing mass updates across multiple unrelated records and performing complex logic. I joined this team in April 2022 and have since been working on releasing changes that aim to consistently improve user productivity and experience.</p>
        <p class="highlight">The primary goal of this Flow Builder's redesign was to offer users a <span>modernized and simplified layout that remains inclusive to all</span>. This involves a cleaner and more visually appealing interface with improved navigation, as well as improving user experience for those that are sight-impaired with colors that meet accessibility requirements. </p>
        <p>The modifications were implemented in Java, Typescript, HTML, and CSS.
        </p>

      </br>

        <h2>So, what's the problem?</h2>
        </br>
        <p style="padding-bottom:30px;">As the Flow Builder user base expands and increasingly complex flows emerge, we received feedback about the challenges of navigating the flow. Previously, the sole navigation method was dragging the canvas to view off-screen elements and scrolling to zoom for clearer visibility.</p>
        <img class="drag-gif" src="img/canvas-enhancements/drag-gif.gif" alt="canvas drag gif">
        <p style="padding-top:30px;"> The following are the core problems this product aims to solve: </p>
        <ul>
          <li class="error-highlight"><span>Users would lose element positioning on the canvas</span>. The zoom level would reset with every element interaction. If you were building a large flow, this was a headache to deal with. It frustrated users and negatively impacted user productivity.</li>
          <li class="error-highlight"><span>The icon colors were inaccessible</span>. They did not meet the contrast ratio of at least 3:1 for graphics and user interface components. This was a requirement specified by Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1. Our features were isolating our users, especially those that are sight-impaired.</li>
        </ul>

          <p>I spent a week researching this popover component as it was a separate library that my team had not utilized before. It involved registering the component within our codebase, and enabling security keys in a separate Java file before we could use the component.</p>
          </br>
          <p>Fortunately, the component’s library was also extensive and implementing requirements 1, 3 and 4 went smoothly once I identified the library’s documentation and determined which lines of code needed tweaking.</p>

          <p class="bold"><span>The real issue</span> was in implementing requirement 2 - keeping the popover anchored.</p>

        </br>
        <p class="highlight">Eventually, I sought the guidance of the Salesforce In-App Guidance team, and together, implemented an algorithm that keeps the popover anchored with every window resize and shift in Flow. This same algorithm has become a core piece in ensuring that the Flow remains <span>adaptable</span> to diverse media sizes and user interactions.</p>
        </br>
        <p>Panels were also adjusted such that they would never overlap with the popover.</p>

        <p class="highlight">This feature involved a simple change in variable value in a file that calculated all element configurations. After spiking this feature, I found <span>two methods of implementation</span> that my team and I could discuss and finalize on.</p>

          <h3 class="heading-padding padding-top">Tricky Terrain</h3>
          <p class="bold">For a change that impacted the entire Flow, it was imperative to <span>ensure compatibility</span> with all connector types - whether straight, curved, or with arrowed ends.</p>
          </br>
          <p class="bold">Additionally, we had to consider <span>special nodes with unique shapes</span> in terms of height and the spacing between nodes.</p>

        <p>Part of the move towards improving the canvas interface was reducing the overall width of the connectors. This also involved a small change in variable value.</p>

              <p class="bold reduce-width-exception">What the UX team didn’t take into consideration was that Flow Builder had <span>a lot</span> of connectors with different shapes and forms.

        <h4 class="heading-padding">Deliverable 5</h4>
        <h3 class="heading-padding">Increase The Contrast Of Nodes And Connectors</h3>
        <p>Prior to this update, Flow Builder displayed colors that were not WCAG 2.1 compliant. The UX team presented me with a list of UX deliverables necessary to address and resolve the color contrast issue.</p>
        <div class="w3-content w3-display-container padding-top-bottom">
          <img class="color-contrast-updates" src="img/canvas-enhancements/icon-color-updates.png" alt="icon color updates">

        </div>
        <p>With these requirements, I began identifying all areas of the codebase that were impacted and required modifications. The code was straightforward, but its application demanded consideration of all node and connector variations. Thus, before embarking on the changes, I needed to thoroughly investigate the source code for these variants and all their possible use cases.</p>
        </br>
        <p class="highlight">This feature adjustment was particularly notable for me. Throughout my career, it was among the few tasks I undertook that highlighted a <span>distinct interface-driven customer need</span>. Addressing this made a direct positive impact on both productivity and inclusivity for its users.

        <p>When I first took on the leadership role for this project, I grappled with self-doubt, often questioning my capabilities as the youngest Software Engineer on a seasoned team. My experience was marked by daily challenges, collaborative brainstorming and intensive problem-solving.</p>
        </br>
        <p class="highlight" style="padding-bottom: 20px">My manager and mentor played crucial roles in encouraging me to <span>stay curious</span>. I'll never forget the response I received to my apprehension about asking questions, which completely transformed my outlook on speaking up.</p>
        </br>
        <p class="quote">“You never know if someone also has the same question as you or if your question might offer a new perspective. By asking your question, you could be helping someone else too.”</p>
        </br>
        <p style="padding-top: 20px">Looking back at the successful impact of the feature on user productivity and accessibility, I'm deeply thankful for my team's unwavering support that fueled my confidence and determination to lead the project to its success.</p>
