        <h2>Introduction</h2>
      </br>
        <p>Flow Builder provides declarative process automation for every Salesforce app, experience, and portal with point-and-click automation. I joined this team in April 2022 and have since been working on releasing changes that aim to consistently improve user productivity and experience.</p>
        <p class="highlight">Within a broader initiative aimed at an improved resource selection experience, this specific project sought to <span>guarantee keyboard accessibility</span> for the redesigned menu.</p>
        <p>The modifications were implemented in Java, Typescript, HTML, and CSS.
        </p>

      </br>

        <h2>So, what's the problem?</h2>
        </br>
        <p>The original Resource Menu (v1) needed a design overhaul.</p>
        <p> The following are the core problems this product aims to solve: </p>
        <ul>
          <li class="error-highlight"><span>Outdated design</span>. The menuâ€™s design was dated in comparison to latest Flow design enhancements.</li>
          <li class="error-highlight"><span>The menu items were disorganized</span>. Menu items that received significant interaction, as identified by the UX team's user research, were located towards the bottom of the menu.</li>
          <li class="error-highlight"><span>Poor user experience</span>. Users found themselves lost after navigating into multi-layered menu items and struggled to backtrack their navigation.</li>
          <li class="error-highlight"><span>Inaccurate icons</span>. The icons for menu items were unclear, and at times, they didn't accurately represent the menu option.</li>
        </ul>
       <p>This is where the revamped Resource Menu (v2) came in. It was intended to prioritize customer needs, and improve usability and user productivity.</p>
       <p class="highlight">Initially, when I was tasked with integrating keyboard navigation for the resource menu, it was clear that the aim was to <span>preserve the keyboard navigation experience</span> akin to v1 for consistency. Yet, the interface of v1 differed from that of v2.</p>
       <p class="highlight">v1 didn't showcase a header or footer, nor did it have a distinct nested menu structure like v2. To ensure keyboard navigation was not only <span>compliant with accessibility standards</span> but also <span>tailored to typical Flow Builder user interactions</span>, every nuanced aspect of keyboard navigation had to be collaboratively addressed by the UX team, Product Managers, and Engineers.</p>

        <p>As the team's Accessibility Champion, I devoted much of my efforts to enhancing accessibility standards across all products under our purview and identifying any that were lacking.</p>
        <p>My responsibilities include:
          <ul>
            <li>Researching and documenting the requirements of making the product 2.1 keyboard accessible.</li>
            <li>Studying the fundamentals of human-centered design for Salesforce products.</li>
            <li>Identifying potential technical challenges.</li>
            <li>Presenting my findings to the UX team, Product Managers and other engineers for critical feedback.</li>
            <li>Implementing code, creating comprehensive test plans and conducting bug blitzes to identify user issues.</li>
            <li>Presenting the end product to key stakeholders and company executives.</li>

          <h2>Guaranteeing Keyboard Navigation</h2>
          </br>
          <p>When I was first assigned the task to implement comprehensive keyboard navigation for the redesigned resource menu, I began researching web accessibility guidelines for menus. Specifically, I was recommended to refer to <a class="content-link" href="https://www.w3.org">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a> for standards and guidelines I could use to apply to our redesigned resource menu.</p>
          </br>
          <p class="highlight">Subsequently, I began documenting my findings and categorizing them into <span>four common scenarios</span> where the focus would land after certain keyboard navigation.
          </p>

      <div class="overall-nav">
        <h2>Delving Into Keyboard Navigation</h2>
        </br>
        <p>With the help of the UX team, I documented and presented my findings using this diagram.</p>
        <div class="row">
          <img class="overall-nav-img padding-top-bottom" src="/img/resource-selection/overall-menu-nav.jpg" alt="overall navigation">

        <p>The pink numbered lines represent the tabbing order and the pink dotted arrows represent up/down/left/right arrow key interactions.</p>
      </br>
        <p>Let's see how I used this diagram to detail the four common focus scenarios.</p>

        </br>
        <p class="highlight">After nearly a year of dedicated effort by my team, the revamped selection experience not only met but exceeded our customer's expectations. We introduced a redesigned resource menu that <span>significantly improved user experience</span> and <span>underscored the importance of accessibility</span>. Besides boasting keyboard compatibility, the menu had more intuitive icons, helpful tooltips for each item accessible by keyboard shortcuts, and clickable breadcrumbs for streamlined navigation.</p>
        <div class="row">
          <img class="overall-exp padding-top-bottom" src="/img/resource-selection/resource-exp.png" alt="overall resource experience">
        </div>
        <p>While the updates to keyboard navigation weren't explicitly highlighted, numerous independent and mainstream articles sang praises for the newly-designed selection experience.</p>

          <img class="resource-reviews padding-top-bottom" src="/img/resource-selection/resource-reviews.png" alt="resource reviews">
        </div>
        <p>Witnessing people genuinely enjoying and appreciating the revamped interface and selection experience emphasized the significance of user-centric feature development.</p>
        </br>
        <p class="highlight">This project not only deepened my understanding of human-centered design in keyboard interaction but also taught me that a product's user experience can <span>evolve</span> - provided that ample support and direction is offered to its users.</p>
