        <h2>Introduction</h2>
      </br>
        <p>Flow Builder provides declarative process automation for every Salesforce app, experience, and portal with point-and-click automation. I joined this team in April 2022 and have since been working on releasing changes that aim to consistently improve user productivity and experience.</p>
        <p class="highlight">The primary goal of this Flow Builder's redesign was to offer users a <span>modernized and simplified layout that remains inclusive to all</span>. This involves a cleaner and more visually appealing interface with improved navigation, as well as improving user experience for those that are sight-impaired with colors that meet the WCAG 2.1 requirements. </p>
        <p>The modifications were implemented in Java, Typescript, HTML, and CSS.
        </p>

      </br>

        <h2>So, what's the problem?</h2>
        </br>
        <p style="padding-bottom:30px;">As the Flow Builder user base expands and increasingly complex flows emerge, we received feedback about the challenges of navigating the flow. Previously, the sole navigation method was dragging the canvas to view off-screen elements and scrolling to zoom for clearer visibility.</p>
        <img src="/img/canvas-enhancements-img/drag-gif.gif" alt="canvas drag gif">
        <p style="padding-top:30px;"> The following are the core problems this product aims to solve: </p>
        <ul>
          <li class="highlight"><span>Users would lose element positioning on the canvas</span>. The zoom level would reset with every element interaction. If you were building a large flow, this was a headache to deal with. It frustrated users and negatively impacted user productivity.</li>
          <li class="highlight"><span>The icon colors were inaccessible</span>. They did not meet the contrast ratio of at least 3:1 for graphics and user interface components. This was a requirement specified by Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1. Our features were isolating our users, especially those that are sight-impaired.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Dec 2022 - Feb 2023</p>
        </br>
        <p class="sub-header">WHAT'D I DO?</p>
        <p>I served as the lead Software Engineer for this feature, overseeing the entire project cycle.</p>
        <p>My responsibilities included:
          <ul>
            <li>Project scoping and presenting proof-of-concepts to discern technical specifications.</li>
            <li>Identifying potential technical challenges.</li>
            <li>Dissecting the feature into digestible work items.</li>
            <li>Implementing code and creating comprehensive test plans.</li>
            <li>Organizing and leading bug blitzes to identify user issues.</li>
            <li>Presenting the end product to key stakeholders and company executives.</li>
           </ul>
         </p>
        <p>During this process, I worked in tandem with the UX team, Product Managers, and my engineering team to ideate and troubleshoot.</p>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p>As a Software Engineer in Salesforce, my responsibilities start when I receive feature deliverables by the User Experience team.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="highlight">I began by conducting a spike, <span>a time-boxed research into the codebase to explore potential solutions and identify technical challenges</span>. This research would conclude with a detailed presentation of my findings and a demo of proof-of-concepts to my team.</p>

        <h2>Add Help Popover</h2>
        </br>
        <p>With the significant visual update, we wanted to provide users a help popover that explains how one can interact with the new interface.</p>

      <div class="shorten-distance-story">
        <h2>Shorten The Distance Between Vertical Nodes</h2>
        </br>
        <p class="highlight">This feature involved a simple change in variable value in a file that calculated all element configurations. After spiking this feature, I found <span>two methods of implementation</span> that my team and I could discuss and finalize on.</p>

        <p>After multiple feedback sessions and multi-team discussions with UX and my team, an acceptable variable value was agreed upon that could meet both the feature requirement and accommodate unique cases like the Decision element.</p>

      <div class="reduce-width-story">
        <h2>Reduce The Width Of Connectors</h2>
