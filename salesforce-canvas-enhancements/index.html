        <h1>Redesigning Salesforce's Flow Builder</h1>
      </div>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      </br>
      <p>Flow Builder is the most powerful automation tool that any Salesforce user has at their disposal. It can be
        used to perform various tasks from sending an email and posting a message to performing mass updates across
        multiple unrelated records and performing complex logic. I joined this team in April 2022 and have since been
        working on releasing changes that aim to consistently improve user productivity and experience.</p>
      <p class="highlight">The primary goal of this Flow Builder's redesign was to offer users a <span>modernized and
          simplified layout that remains inclusive to all</span>. This involves a cleaner and more visually appealing
        interface with improved navigation, as well as improving user experience for those that are sight-impaired with
        colors that meet accessibility requirements. </p>
      <p>The modifications were implemented in Java, Typescript, HTML, and CSS.
      </p>

      </br>

      <h2>So, what's the problem?</h2>
      </br>
      <p style="padding-bottom:30px;">As the Flow Builder user base expands and increasingly complex flows emerge, we
        received feedback about the challenges of navigating the flow. Previously, the sole navigation method was
        dragging the canvas to view off-screen elements and scrolling to zoom for clearer visibility.</p>
      <img class="drag-gif" src="../img/canvas-enhancements/drag-gif.gif" alt="canvas drag gif">
      <p style="padding-top:30px;"> The following are the core problems this product aims to solve: </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="error-highlight"><span>Users would lose element positioning on the canvas</span>. The zoom level
          would reset with every element interaction. If you were building a large flow, this was a headache to deal
          with. It frustrated users and negatively impacted user productivity.</li>
        <li class="error-highlight"><span>The icon colors were inaccessible</span>. They did not meet the contrast ratio
          of at least 3:1 for graphics and user interface components. This was a requirement specified by Web Content
          Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1. Our features were isolating our users, especially those that are
          sight-impaired.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>I served as the lead Software Engineer for this feature, overseeing the entire project cycle.</p>
      <p>My responsibilities included:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Project Scoping & Proof-of-Concepts —</strong> Scoped the project and presented proof-of-concepts to
          identify technical specifications.</li>
        <li><strong>Technical Challenge Identification —</strong> Identified potential technical challenges and
          developed
          solutions.</li>
        <li><strong>Feature Breakdown & Work Item Analysis —</strong> Dissected the feature into manageable work items
          for execution.</li>
        <li><strong>Code Implementation & Test Planning —</strong> Implemented code and created detailed test plans for
          functionality and performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Bug Blitz Organization & Issue Identification —</strong> Led and organized bug blitzes to detect and
          resolve user issues.</li>
        <li><strong>Final Product Presentation —</strong> Presented the completed product to stakeholders and executives
          for final review and approval.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>During this process, I worked in tandem with the UX team, Product Managers, and my engineering team to ideate
        and troubleshoot.</p>

          <p>I spent a week researching this popover component as it was a separate library that my team had not
            utilized before. It involved registering the component within our codebase, and enabling security keys in a
            separate Java file before we could use the component.</p>
          </br>
          <p>Fortunately, the component’s library was also extensive and implementing requirements 1, 3 and 4 went
            smoothly once I identified the library’s documentation and determined which lines of code needed tweaking.

          implemented an algorithm that keeps the popover anchored with every window resize and shift in Flow. This same

          sizes and user interactions.</p>

        </br>
        <p>1 - Modify a key variable, but manually update other impacted variables along the way <i>or</i></p>

        <p>With these requirements, I began identifying all areas of the codebase that were impacted and required
          modifications. The code was straightforward, but its application demanded consideration of all node and
          connector variations. Thus, before embarking on the changes, I needed to thoroughly investigate the source
          code for these variants and all their possible use cases.</p>

        <p class="highlight">This feature adjustment was particularly notable for me. Throughout my career, it was among

          this made a direct positive impact on both productivity and inclusivity for its users.

        <p>When I first took on the leadership role for this project, I grappled with self-doubt, often questioning my
          capabilities as the youngest Software Engineer on a seasoned team. My experience was marked by daily
          challenges, collaborative brainstorming and intensive problem-solving.</p>
        </br>
        <p class="highlight" style="padding-bottom: 20px">My manager and mentor played crucial roles in encouraging me
          to <span>stay curious</span>. I'll never forget the response I received to my apprehension about asking
          questions, which completely transformed my outlook on speaking up.</p>
        </br>
        <p class="quote fade-in">“You never know if someone also has the same question as you or if your question might
          offer a

        <p style="padding-top: 20px">Looking back at the successful impact of the feature on user productivity and
          accessibility, I'm deeply thankful for my team's unwavering support that fueled my confidence and
