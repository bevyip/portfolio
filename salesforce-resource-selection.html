        <h2>Introduction</h2>
      </br>
        <p>Flow Builder is the most powerful automation tool that any Salesforce user has at their disposal (see <a class="content-link" href="/portfolio/salesforce-canvas-enhancements">Case Study #1</a>). It can be used to perform various tasks from sending an email and posting a message to performing mass updates across multiple unrelated records and performing complex logic. I joined this team in April 2022 and have since been working on releasing changes that aim to consistently improve user productivity and experience.</p>
        <p class="highlight">Flow Builder's Resource Menu displays the resources that are available in the flow. Within a broader initiative aimed at an improved resource selection experience, this specific project sought to <span>guarantee keyboard accessibility</span> for the redesigned menu.</p>
        <p>The modifications were implemented in Java, Typescript, HTML, and CSS.
        </p>

      </br>

        <h2>So, what's the problem?</h2>
        </br>
        <p>The original Resource Menu (v1) needed a design overhaul.</p>
        <p> The following are the core problems this product aims to solve: </p>
        <ul>
          <li class="error-highlight"><span>Outdated design</span>. The menuâ€™s design was dated in comparison to latest Flow design enhancements.</li>
          <li class="error-highlight"><span>The menu items were disorganized</span>. Menu items that received significant interaction, as identified by the UX team's user research, were located towards the bottom of the menu.</li>
          <li class="error-highlight"><span>Poor user experience</span>. Users found themselves lost after navigating into multi-layered menu items and struggled to backtrack their navigation.</li>
          <li class="error-highlight"><span>Inaccurate icons</span>. The icons for menu items were unclear, and at times, they didn't accurately represent the menu option.</li>
        </ul>
       <p>This is where the revamped Resource Menu (v2) came in. This new design, provided by the UX team, was intended to prioritize customer needs, and improve usability and user productivity.</p>
       <p class="highlight">Initially, when I was tasked with integrating keyboard navigation for the resource menu, it was clear that the aim was to <span>preserve the keyboard navigation experience</span> akin to v1 for consistency. Yet, the interface of v1 differed from that of v2.</p>
       <p class="highlight">v1 didn't showcase a header or footer, nor did it have a distinct nested menu structure like v2. To ensure keyboard navigation was not only <span>compliant with accessibility standards</span> but also <span>tailored to typical Flow Builder user interactions</span>, every nuanced aspect of keyboard navigation had to be collaboratively addressed by the UX team, Product Managers, and Engineers.</p>

        <p>As the team's Accessibility Champion, I devoted much of my efforts to enhancing accessibility standards across all products under our purview and identifying any that were lacking.</p>
        <p>My responsibilities include:
          <ul>
            <li>Researching and documenting the requirements of making the product 2.1 keyboard accessible.</li>
            <li>Studying the fundamentals of human-centered design for Salesforce products.</li>
            <li>Identifying potential technical challenges.</li>
            <li>Presenting my findings to the UX team, Product Managers and other engineers for critical feedback.</li>
            <li>Implementing code, creating comprehensive test plans and conducting bug blitzes to identify user issues.</li>
            <li>Presenting the end product to key stakeholders and company executives.</li>

          <h2 class="heading-padding padding-top">Guaranteeing Keyboard Navigation</h2>
          </br>
          <p>When I was first assigned the task to implement comprehensive keyboard navigation for the redesigned resource menu, I began researching web accessibility guidelines for menus. Specifically, I was recommended to refer to <a class="content-link" href="https://www.w3.org">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a> for standards and guidelines I could use to apply to our redesigned resource menu.</p>
          </br>
          <p class="highlight">Subsequently, I began documenting my findings and categorizing them into <span>four common scenarios</span> where the focus would land after certain keyboard navigation.
          </p>

        <h2 class="heading-padding padding-top">Delving Into Keyboard Navigation</h2>
        </br>
        <p>With the help of the UX team, I documented and presented my findings using this diagram.</p>
        <div class="row overall-nav-img-section">

        <p>Let's see how I used this diagram to detail the four common focus scenarios.</p>

          <h2 class="heading-padding">Yikes, tabbing road bump!</h2>
          </br>
          <p class="bold">In the v2 design that now included a header and footer, determining the <span>new tabbing order</span> was most essential.</p>
          </br>
          <p class="highlight-blue">There were conflicting views on whether tabbing from the input field should move the focus to the menu item (as it does in v1) or to the â€˜New Resourceâ€˜ option. The former prioritized <span>user familiarity</span> while the latter prioritized <span>adhering to 2.1 global keyboard accessibility standards</span>.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="eureka padding-top">
          <h2 class="heading-padding">Eureka!</h2>
          </br>
          <p class="bold">Flow Builder is a point-and-click automation tool. That meant that individuals with <span>low vision</span> (who may have trouble finding or tracking a pointer indicator on screen) and those who have <span>difficulty with using the mouse</span> face challenges in using our product if keyboard alternatives are lacking.</p>
          </br>
          <p class="highlight">Hence, the team agreed on the <span>importance of upholding 2.1 global keyboard accessibility</span> and pursued the â€˜New Resourceâ€˜ option.</p>
          </br>
          <p>To tackle the concern of user unfamiliarity, we decided to also incorporate help popups to assist users in grasping the updated keyboard navigation.</p>
          </br>
          <p class="highlight">Attempting to release a product with inaccessible features simply made no sense. A product that boasts enhanced user experience should ensure that whatâ€™s user-friendly for one user is <span>equally accessible and intuitive</span> to another.</p>

        <p class="highlight">After nearly a year of dedicated effort by my team, the revamped selection experience not only met but exceeded our customer's expectations. We introduced a redesigned resource menu that <span>significantly improved user experience</span> and <span>underscored the importance of accessibility</span>. Besides boasting keyboard compatibility, the menu had more intuitive icons, helpful tooltips for each item accessible by keyboard shortcuts, and clickable breadcrumbs for streamlined navigation.</p>
        </br>
        <p>While the updates to keyboard navigation weren't explicitly highlighted, numerous independent and mainstream articles sang praises for the newly-designed selection experience.</p>
